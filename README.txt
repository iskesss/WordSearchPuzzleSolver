Please note that the algorithm itself is entirely contained within 'main.cpp', but that 'words.txt' (the dictionary from which my algorithm learns English) must be present in the same directory.

On line 45 of main.cpp you'll be able to change the name of the word search puzzle file which my algorithm considers. I've included three test puzzles which I found online.

Thanks for trying my code!
